									<p>M.E.Gosla has been writing fantastical stories since she was in the third grade. Turning her fears of everyday life into an otherworldly adventure with whimsical twist and turns. Attending Southern New Hampshire undergraduate bachelor’s degree in English with a concentration in creative writing has helped the foundation of her current projects. She is currently in the Southern New Hampshire MFA program in Speculative Fiction.  Her stories bring awareness and empower those who society has determined “not normal” because of their mental, emotional, physical disabilities makes her characters relate-able to all walks of life.  When she isn’t writing, drawing out scenes, researching, or brainstorming new ideas. She can be found curled up engulfed in a book.</p><br>
									<h2>FAQ</h2>
									<p>What is the first book that made you cry?<br>

											Island of the Blue Dolphins by Scott O’Dell<br></p>

											<hr>
											 <p>Coffee or Tea first thing in the morning? <br>  
											
											  Tea <br></p>
											
											<p>How do you build your characters?<br>
											
											 First I like to figure out the gender, the name, age, and flaws. Then, I draw a quick stretch of what I think the character would possibly look like.</p> 
											
											<p>How many hours a day do you write?<br>
											
											 I write about four to five hours in a day, but sometimes I can write for almost ten hours.</p>
											
											
											<p>How do you select the names of your characters?<br>
											I select names based on their meaning from a list or browsing through Pinterest then look at the character mold I have outlined. Using both to decide a name then try to come up with a suitable last name.</p>
